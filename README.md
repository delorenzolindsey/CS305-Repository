Who was the client and what issue did they want addressed?

The client is called "Artemis Financial" and was in the business of banking. This client wanted to insure their information and their customers' information would be safe. Their information is highly sensitive and needed thew best level of protection with encrypting to insure only the correct user gained assess to the information.

What did I do well when I found the software security vulerabilities? Whay is it important to code securely? What does software security add to a company's overall wellbeing?

I found what parts of the software needed updating using the dependency check. Many items within the code were vulerable due to running on older versions of software.

What part of the assessment was challenging or helpful?

This may sound silly but the hardest part of the assessment is figuring out where the plugin code was supposed to go in the pom file. Everywhere in reading and lessons told be what to add but never the correct syntax to add it. It took me a few YouTube videos to figure it out. Another hard challenge within this assessment was that I could not connect to my local host and had to search other ways of achiving the same goal. 

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would I use to addess vulnerabilities and decide which mitgration technigues to use?

I would reuse the dependency check in my future coding practices. I feel as if this would help give a helpful assistance to finding the vulenerabilities that I can then fix from that point.

How did I make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refoactoring the code, how did you check to see whether I introduced new vulnerabilities?

This is a challange that I am not as comfortably confident as this stage in my studies. I understand how to fix a handful but not every task. I do feel confident, however, that this is a simple task to master the skill overtime with practice throughout my coding learning journey.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did I use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks.

Future assignments will focus on different specific skills. This course only dipped in a few skills, but I do believe I will need to add plugins, encrypt code, and update older versions of software.

Employer sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

Future employers will understand the progress speed in which these tasks were learned. I knew nothing about code before starting classes at SNHU. When I share my studies with students of the same major I do not hear of many 100% beginners pursing this field. Most I exchange the topic with have a bit of background on the subject. I feel confident thjat my skills at this speed, my determination to find the solution when facing challenges, and my new love and passion for this field will be seen through my progress progression.
